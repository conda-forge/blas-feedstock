Configuration subroutine to validate and canonicalize a configuration type.
Supply the specified configuration type as an argument. If it is invalid, we
print an error message on stderr and exit with code 1.Otherwise, we print the
canonical config type on stdout and succeed.
You can get the latest version of this script
from:http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub
This file is supposed to be the same for all GNU packages and recognize all the
CPU types, system types and aliases that are meaningful with *any* GNU software.
Each package is responsible for reporting which valid configurations it does not
support.  The user should be able to distinguish a failure to support a valid
configuration from a meaningless configuration.
The goal of this file is to map all the various variations of a given machine
specification into a single specification in the
form:CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
or in some cases, the newer four-part
form:CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM. It is wrong to echo any
other type of specification.

This texinfo.tex file is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.
This texinfo.tex file is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more
details.You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along

As a special exception, when this file is read by TeX when processing a Texinfo
source document, you may use the result without restriction. This Exception is
an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License,
version 3 ("GPLv3").
Please try the latest version of texinfo.tex before submitting bug reports; you
can get the latest version from: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/ (the Texinfo
release area), or
http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo/ (same, via a mirror), or
http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/ (the Texinfo home page) The texinfo.tex in
any given distribution could well be out
of date, so if that's what you're using, please check.
Send bug reports to bug-texinfo@gnu.org.  Please include including a complete
document in each bug report with which we can reproduce the problem.  Patches
are, of course, greatly appreciated.
To process a Texinfo manual with TeX, it's most reliable to use the texi2dvi
shell script that comes with the distribution.  For a simple manual foo.texi,
however, you can get away with this:
tex foo.texi
texindex foo.??
tex foo.texi
tex foo.texi
dvips foo.dvi -o  # or whatever; this makes foo.ps.
The extra TeX runs get the cross-reference information correct. Sometimes one
run after texindex suffices, and sometimes you need more than two; texi2dvi does
it as many times as necessary.
It is possible to adapt texinfo.tex for other languages, to some extent.  You
can get the existing language-specific files from the full Texinfo distribution.
The GNU Texinfo home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo.
